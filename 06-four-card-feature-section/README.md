## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Responsive design using media queries

### What I learned

In this challenge, what I gained the most wasn't the new tools I learned, but the application of logic.

When faced with a problem, try breaking it down and then reassembling it. In my case, thinking in terms of four separate boxes was very confusing at first. However, when I grouped the second and third boxes together and applied properties to them, it became much easier to distinguish the areas.

This approach helped me organize and manage the content more effectively, improving both my design efficiency and the clarity of the results.
